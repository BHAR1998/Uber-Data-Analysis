Uber NYC Data Analysis and Revenue Estimation (2014-2015)
This project analyzes Uber trip data in New York City from September 2014 to August 2015, consisting of 31 million rows. The dataset includes details on trip origin, destination, pickup and drop-off times, trip distance, and duration. Through this analysis, I aimed to estimate Uber’s revenue per trip and its overall financial performance in NYC during this one-year period.

Project Overview:
I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to investigate patterns in Uber rides across NYC over a year. The analysis included:

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values using mean and mode imputation.
Feature Engineering: Created new columns for year, month, day, and trip revenue to support further analysis.
Revenue Estimation: Computed Uber’s total and average revenue per trip using the following fare structure:


Base fare: $2.55

Per minute: $0.35

Per mile: $1.75

Minimum fare: $8


Key Findings:

Peak Hours: Demand for Uber rides is highest between 4 PM and midnight.

Weekly Trends: Demand increases steadily from Monday to Saturday, with Saturday being the busiest day. Interestingly, Sunday has higher demand than Monday or Tuesday.
Seasonal Trends: Significant events such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, Memorial Day, and Independence Day affected the number of trips.

Revenue Insights:

Total revenue for Uber in NYC during the year: $595 million USD

Revenue growth in NYC: 84%

Gross margin: $149 million USD
